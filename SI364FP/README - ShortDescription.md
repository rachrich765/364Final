With this project, everyone who visits localhost://5000 can register for an account, input a hashtag they are confused by in the database, view the definition of this hashtag, and view all of the confusing tweeters that are in the database. If they want to view more, they must login to their account. Once they have logged in, they can create a collection of hashtags, delete a collection of hashtags, view all the collections they have made, and update the difficulty to understand a given hashtag now that they know the definiton.
